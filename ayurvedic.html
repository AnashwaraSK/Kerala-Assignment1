		Developed in India over 3,000 years ago, Ayurvedic medicine is one of the oldest healing systems in the world, focused on a balance of therapies that heal the mind, body, and spirit. Ayurvedic resorts are plentiful in Kerala, a state of India along its southwestern Malabar Coast, due to the moist, humid climate and abundant supply of medicinal plants and herbs that grow there.<br>
		At these resorts in Kerala, not only can you rejuvenate your body, you can have a wonderful vacation as well. However, the treatments at some Ayurvedic resorts are much better than others. These top Kerala Ayurvedic resorts are all well managed and have an excellent range of properly administered Ayurvedic treatments.<br>
		To save money, go during the monsoon season (from June to September). The weather is perfect for Ayurveda at that time, too! You'll also find some excellent holistic India wellness centers in other states. However, if you have a serious illness, consider an Ayurvedic hospital as an alternative. Here are some of the ayurvedic centres:
