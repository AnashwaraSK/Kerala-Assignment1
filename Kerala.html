		Kerala, the land of God, has plenty of cool things to do that you must not miss out on! Here’s a guide for Kerala especially for the first-timers who want to see some of Kerala’s best attractions plus several other tips to support you on your journey. Stretching along the south-western corner of India along the tropical Malabar Coast, boasting everything from vast beaches and picturesque backwaters to exotic nature and rich heritage, Kerala is without question one of India’s most beautiful states. Thanks to its scenic beauty and loads of activities available, Kerala has been a popular place for travelers since a very long time.
			<br>
		The best way to discover the things to do in Kerala, is to immerse yourself in cultural encounters and explore the beautiful countryside. The wealth of natural beauty in the form of placid backwaters, lush greenery, picturesque hill towns, and beautiful beaches has resulted in the name ‘God’s Own Country.’ Munnar’s stunning tea plantations and Alappuzha’s serene backwaters make it into every list of what to see in Kerala.
			<br>
		Cultural activities like Kathakali, the classical dance style and martial art kalarippayattu are some of the other major tourist attractions in Kerala. Travelers also look forward to try some lip-smacking food since Kerala offers a variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian cuisine. Ayurvedic massages and treatments are also immensely popular among those who see a rejuvenation of the mind and body. Some resorts, hotels and special centers are devoted to Ayurvedic health programs.
